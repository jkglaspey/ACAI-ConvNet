# ACAI-ConvNet

## Abstract

This project addresses the challenge of identifying military aircraft from aerial images using computer vision (CV) techniques. For this project, we created a dataset of labeled aircraft using RoboFlow to demonstrate the capabilities of our models to learn and recognize different vehicles. We then applied data augmentation techniques to increase the effectiveness of our dataset and models.

The study explores the performance of three different CV modelsâ€”YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and a custom deep learning implementation (ConvNet) built using PyTorch. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, designed and documented by Ultralytics, were implemented as baseline models for comparison. Our custom model was designed to address shortcomings observed in the baseline models, focusing on balancing computational efficiency and detection accuracy. By evaluating these models, we identified performance trade-offs and gained valuable insights into optimizing CV models for accurate aircraft detection in realistic datasets.
